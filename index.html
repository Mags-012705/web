        <h2 id= "Choosing a Tablet"> Choosing a Tablet</h2>
        <p>   When you first begin digital art, the first thing you should consider is what you are going to use. By this, I mean what device you would like to use in you art. Some artists get along just fine using a phone or ipad. Many, however, prefer to draw on their computer, and to do so requires the purchase of a drawing tablet. Here today we discuss the options </p>
   <div>     
        <h3 id= "Your Options"> Your Options</h3>
        <p> There are many device options. The current most popular seems to an I-Pad Pro with an Apple pen as it is very easy to adapt. However, that option is very expensive and may not be avaliable to everyone. </p>
        <p> What of drawing tablets then? Drawing tablets are divided into 2 categories. Display tablets with screens and those without. Typically, display tablets are much more expensive that those without screens. When buying a drawing tablet, you may come across several terms. Below, we define a few of them and other things to consider when buying a tablet.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Pen Pressure : How well the tablet picks up what you are drawing. Do you have to press very hard? Typicallu, you do not need a very high pen pressure, but you need at least some pen pressure. These days, most tablets have at least 8000 levels of pen pressure though</li>
        <li> Tilt Support/Sensitivity: How well the tablet picks up the angle of the pen. Typically, you'll need at least some tilt sensitivity, but it is not a deal breaker if a tablet has high tilt support or not</li>
        <li> Display Size: How large the tablet is. Usually, display tablets are larger than regular ones. What you prefer is entirely up to personal preference and available room though. If you mainly use keyboard shortcuts in your art, you may want to consider a smaller tablet so you have easy access to your keyboard.</li>
        <li> Express Keys: Express Keys are buttons that you can link keyboard shortcuts to. Some tablets also have a dial. Whether these are necessary is entirely up to you.</li>
        <li> Stylus: The stylus is the pen that you draw on a tablet with. When buying a tablet, it is necessary to consider whether you want a battery free stylus or a rechargeable one.</li>
        </ul>
       <p><a href = "https://ecommerce-platforms.com/articles/what-to-consider-when-buying-a-graphics-tablet"> Here is a website with other things you may want to consider in your art. </a></p>
        </div>
    <div>
        <h3 id = "What to Choose"> What to Choose </h3>
        <p> With all these things to consider, what should you choose as a beginner then? First, you should consider the amount of space you have at your workspace. I'd say buying a tablet bigger than half your workspace is unecessary. Next, consider your budget. Tablets get more and more expensive the better they are and honestly, it gets a bit jaring at the higher prices. Thus, consider your budget and don't buy at the top end of your budget. Finally, look online for reccomendations on beginners tablets or, if you prefer a big name brand, buy second hand ones. The most commonly reccomended beginners tablet is the Wacom Inutos, but that can get a bit pricey so consider buying a good condition second hand instead. At the end of the day, it's all down to personal preference, but don't make a decision rashly. For reference, here is a list of popular tablet brands.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Wacom</li>
        <li> XP-Pen</li>
        <li> Huion</li>
        </ul>
        <p> For reference, I started drawing first on a phone and then bought a XP-Pen Deco v1.</p>
        
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id = "What Program, You Ask?"> What Program, You Ask?</h2>
        <p> On handheld devices and such devices, your choices are limited to what's avaliable on the app store. Here is a list of popular drawing apps though. Please do note that many computer applications now also have apps, so consider searching for those as well.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Procreate</li>
        <li> ibis Paint</li>
        <li> Autodesk Sketchbook</li>
        <li> Adobe Photoshop</li>
        <li> Clip Studio Paint</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> There exists many popular computer applications for drawing. When choosing one, also consider the price and the amount of space you have on your computer. Search up the reccommended requirements beforehand. As always, some programs are popular, but expensive and others are subpar, but free. Here are a few options to consider. Of course, you can always switch between programs as each program has its own quirks. There are comments on programs I've researched into.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Adobe Photoshop: Wildly Popular, but requires a subscription. May be confusing for newcomers.</li>
        <li> Clip Studio Paint: Wildly Popular, requires a purchase. Offers assets and such. May be confusing for newcomers. Recommended to buy during Black Friday Sales.</li>
        <li> Paint Tool Sai: Wildly Popular. Again, requires a purchase. Note that it offers a version 1 and 2. Both are avaliable with one purchase though.</li>
        <li> Krita : Free. A group project of sorts to create a good free applicatio, so may be a bit janky. Offers online version.</li>
        <li> FireAlpaca : Personally do not like it due to it's janky settings. </li>
        <li> Medibang Paint</li>
        <li> Gimp</li>
        <li> Inkscape</li>
        <li> Autodesk Sketchbook</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> Do some research and consider the options. Extra note: There exists many programs out there and as many people hate Adobe for hiking their Creative Cloud prices, there exists many rant threads out there that offer alternatives. Consider the programs on those threads as well.</p>
        
        <p> Here are two of those afformentioned threads, though you may need a Tumblr account. As for why they're both Tumblr links... I'm on Tumblr too often okay?!</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/justpickupthatpen/632808705873887232"> Thread 1</a></li>
        <li><a href = "https://www.tumblr.com/blog/view/delightfullyodd/185019031203">Thread 2</a> </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> *pst* There's pirated versions of Paint Tool Sai out there. Look on Youtube.</p>

    <h2 id = "Getting Started"> Getting Started</h2>
        <p> So you have a tablet and a program. Now what? First things first, go to your tablet company's website and find the driver for your specific tablet to download. The driver is basically what allows your tablet to connect to the computer. Remember to visit the website periodically to download new updates to it.</p>
        <p> Moving on, after you've plugged in your tablet and ran the driver, you may notice pen sensitivity charts and express key buttons. Yes, you can mess with those to find what you are comfortable with. Be sure to export those settings those because they get erased when you download a new update.</p>
        
        <p> Now let's open your program! You might notice that there's a lot of different things the program can do. You should take the time here to try out some things and get used to the program overall. This may take some time to do so don't sweat it if you don't get things right away. In cases like these, the internet is your absolute best friend. Really though, at this stage, there's nothing else to do, but try to get used to drawing digitally. It's a huge transition from drawing tradiitonally to drawing digitally and it'll take some time. You may also want to reorganize your workspace if the program allows you to do so.</p>
        
        <p> Anyway, that's about it in regards to getting started. Really, it just takes time and you can always find something new to do. In times like these, you might not know where to get started so maybe follow a tutorial on Youtube at first. Just slowly get used to it and try not to use mess things up too much. Of course, if you do, you can always delete and reinstall the program to reset it. It won't cost you anything.</p>
        
        <p> Here are some Youtube Tutorials to Help You Navigate some Programs</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFyOznL9UvA&ab_channel=AlecMarkarian"> Adobe Photoshop</a></li>

        <h2 id = "Practice">Practice, Practice, Practice </h2>
        <p> And here's the final note from me. Drawing digitally is so different from drawing traditionally that it requires years of practice to get somewhere you are satisfied with. Honestly, even after doing this for half a year, I am still not satisfied with what I've done so far. At some point though, you may feel the need to update the equipment you have. That's fine, after you've reached a certain point, your equipment will start hindering you and it's natural to upgrade. However, when you feel something is wrong, do not immediately turn to getting a new upgrade or new assests and such. Getting new things will not improve your digital art ability. All you can do to get there is work through it. Find guides online and learn. Most things that apply to digital art like color theory, perspective, compostition, etc. apply to digital art too, so take the time to study art techniques. There is no easy road in the end. It's all just hard work and honestly, you'll probably get tired at some point and it's okay to take a break. If you take a break for too long though, your skill will end up deteriorating though so watch out.  </p>
        
        <p> Personally, I'm also working on a few art things. Here's a list of resources I've used so far to learn various things:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> Coloring</li>
            <ul>
            <li><a href= "https://yokoboo.tumblr.com/post/138358905112/shading-colour-tips"> Shading</a></li>
            <li><a href = "https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-theory-design"> Simple Color Theory</a></li>    
            </ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeySBnV71dyC-gwqapq9NwQ"> Anatomy</a></li>    
        </ul>
        
        <p> I'd also recommend to follow and support other artists in order to learn from their process. Really though, they got there after a lot of hard work and most artists are willing to provide resources for their followers to learn from.</p>
