<!--
There are 6 types of headings and each is smaller than the previous. 
Remember to begin each html doc with <!DOCTYPE> and <html> and end with </html>.
Prompts usually need to end with </prompt> so remember which ones need ending. 
title is what pops up in the tabs bar, not a title in the actual page
